# Dog-Identification-App
Dog Identification App

## Project Overview
In this project, we will learn how to build a convolution neural network (CNN) to identify a dog's breed. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify and predicate the dog's breed. If the input image is an image of a human, this code will report the resembling dog breed. During this project, we will build CNN from scratch and transfer learning.
