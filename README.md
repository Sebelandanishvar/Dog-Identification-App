# Dog-Identification-App
Dog Identification App

## Project Overview
In this project, we will learn how to build a convolution neural network (CNN) to identify a dog's breed. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify and predicate the dog's breed. If the input image is an image of a human, this code will report the resembling dog breed. During this project, we will build CNN from scratch and transfer learning.

Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch: 
- Prepare the training, validation and testing data.
- Build the CNN layers using the Keras library.
- Choose the Optimizer.
- Train the network and save the checkpoints (Best model).
- Test the model.

The typical transfer-learning workflow:
- Discover a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.
- Freeze all layers in the base model.
- Create a new model on top of the output of one or several layers from the base model.
- Train your new model on your new dataset
