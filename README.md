Dog Identification App

## Project Overview
In this project, we will learn how to build to a convolution neural netwok (CNN) to indtify dog's breed. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify and predicate the dogâ€™s breed. If the input image is an image of a human, this code will report the resembling dog breed.
