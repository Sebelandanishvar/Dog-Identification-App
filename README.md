# Dog-Identification-App
Dog Identification App

## Project Overview
In this project, we will learn how to build a convolution neural network (CNN) to identify a dog's breed. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify and predicate the dog's breed. If the input image is an image of a human, this code will report the resembling dog breed. During this project, we will build CNN from scratch and transfer learning.

## Project Instructions
1- Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

2- Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

3- Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it path/to/dog-project/lfw. 


4- Donwload the VGG-16 and VGG-19 bottleneck features for the dog dataset and place it in path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
